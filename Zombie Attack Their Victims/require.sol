/*
In our zombie game, we don't want the user to be able to create unlimited zombies in their army by repeatedly calling createRandomZombie — it would make the game not very fun.

Let's use require to make sure this function only gets executed one time per user, when they create their first zombie.

Put a require statement at the beginning of createRandomZombie. The function should check to make sure ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] is equal to 0, and throw an error otherwise.
Notee: In Solidity, it doesn't matter which term you put first — both orders are equivalent. However, since our answer checker is really basic, it will only accept one answer as correct — it's expecting ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] to come first.
