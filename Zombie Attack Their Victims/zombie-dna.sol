/*
First we need to make sure that _targetDna isn't longer than 16 digits. To do this, we can set _targetDna equal to _targetDna % dnaModulus to only take the last 16 digits.

Next our function should declare a uint named newDna, and set it equal to the average of myZombie's DNA and _targetDna (as in the example above).

Notee: You can access the properties of myZombie using myZombie.name and myZombie.dna

Once we have the new DNA, let's call _createZombie. You can look at the zombiefactory.sol tab if you forget which parameters this function needs to call it. Notee that it requires a name, so let's set our new zombie's name to "NoName" for now â€” we can write a function to change zombies' names later.
