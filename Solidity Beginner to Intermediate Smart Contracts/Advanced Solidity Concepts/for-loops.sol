/*
Let's finish our getZombiesByOwner function by writing a for loop that iterates through all the zombies in our DApp, compares their owner to see if we have a match, and pushes them to our result array before returning it.

Declare a uint called counter and set it equal to 0. We'll use this variable to keep track of the index in our result array.

Declare a for loop that starts from uint i = 0 and goes up through i < zombies.length. This will iterate over every zombie in our array.

Inside the for loop, make an if statement that checks if zombieToOwner[i] is equal to _owner. This will compare the two addresses to see if we have a match.

Inside the if statement:

Add the zombie's ID to our result array by setting result[counter] equal to i.
Increment counter by 1 (see the for loop example above).
That's it â€” the function will now return all the zombies owned by _owner without spending any gas.
